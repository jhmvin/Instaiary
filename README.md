Instairay is a *Personal Journal* application that allows you to attach photos and video with your journal entry. It uses SQLite to store your entries and your media is saved within your internal memory. This application was developed using **Eclipse ADT**.


This was the first application I created in my *Android Development* class back when I was still a third year college student.

This project is now published under [MIT Open Source License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
